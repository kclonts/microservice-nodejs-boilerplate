# microservice-nodejs-boilerplate
Boilerplate project to show what a simple nodejs-express microservice should look like

I'll be using Docker-Compose to automate and isolate the service with a fresh database to use during testing

We have some endpoints
* multiply a number provided by 2
* log the headers from a request
* send some data to mocked APIs
